# [War Room](war-room-py.herokuapp.com) ðŸ’» ðŸ“¡ 

Pull data from anywhere on the web and make live graphs without being a programmer.  This is a proof of concept that happened to work out!

-----

# How to use

You'll be prompted for a `URL` and `Xpath` to make a "place".  These places point to one piece of data we can collect to make a time-series graph.  

A collection of places makes up the dashboards we call "Rooms", presenting them however you want, like this-

!["coinbase-example"](/static/coinbase-example.png)


# Road Map

* Live graphs

* Better frontend

* User Authentication

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dy-fi/war-room-py.git
cd war-room-py
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

The app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). Make sure MongoDB is installed and MongoDB Daemon is running.
